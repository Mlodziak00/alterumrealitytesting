                    Eyre K. Bones joined Alterum Reality Testing Co. or A.R.T. in 2015 after many successful 
                    years at Solomon University, graduating Cume Laude. Entering as a sophomore in college from 
                    the internship program they quickly became a star pupil and familiar face within the facility. 
                    Being one of two accepted applicants alongside Anderson Omen.  Doctor Bones after graduation 
                    would enter a separate department and quickly climb the ranks for their hard work and ruthlessness 
                    in the name of science.<br><br>

                    Eyre K. Bones was officially given the title of the Head of Sector Warren in 2019, after a remarkable discovery. 
                    Though many notes of the experiment remain undisclosed to the public. They then gathered a cabinet of notable doctors 
                    to help run their Sector, which to this day has been noted as one of the most efficient and well organized research labs 
                    in A.R.T. 's history. Doctor Boneâ€™s and their team continue to bring innovation and understanding to the table time and 
                    time again.
